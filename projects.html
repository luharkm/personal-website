                                At HackUCI 2015, my partner and I worked with a Microsoft Kinect sensor  and an Occulus Rift Virtual Reality (VR) headset (and Google Cardboard) connected by the Unity game engine, learning many device features from scratch. Our project was centered around combining the interactivity of the Kinect and the VR of the Occulus Rift to make a game that created a fun, Portal-esque, environment in which computer science basics (specifically simple data structures) could be taught and explored. We were unable to finish because of our small team size (only the two of us) and technical difficulties in using Kinect depth data for fine control and movement (that even the Microsoft team at the event could not fully solve); regardless, we left with a much more comprehensive understanding of the inner workings/software behind Kinect and Unity, as well as at least two days worth of sleep debt.</p>

                                During summer's end in 2015, I created a solution for a trivial, yet problematic, process I had suffered through the previous year; checking the dining menus quickly and easily on my phone without having to tap numerous times to open my browser, navigate to the UCLA dining website, and zoom in to view menus as the page itself distorted from the magnification. So, with an Android phone and the ability to develop on it, I created a library that parsed the UCLA dining website and an Android app to display results in a native and easy-on-the-eyes, one-tap, environment. If I get time in the future, I am also interested in developing a rating system for UCLA dining (that could be accessed through the app, etc.) so meals could be rated in real time for students to decide what and where to eat quickly.

                                During my freshman year in UCLA, I happened upon an innovative startup called PlayFull that awarded users free and discounted food from local restaurant for playing games; how genius is that! Intrigued, I interviewed with PlayFull and started an internship with them as an Android developer. After the internship period ended, I continued working with PlayFull as Lead Android Developer for a total of one year. During this time period, I learned a great deal about Android/front-end programming, and numerous soft skills from working in a team, and can now develop quality Android applications from start to finish.<br>See <a href="http://beplayfull.com/">BePlayFull</a> for more details.

                                During the summer before entering UCLA, I experimented with different types of programming, and became interested in game and mobile development; so I put them together to create my first Android app/game, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kongligit.amaze.android">amaze</a>. To explore the fields, I created a simple endless maze game running on the libGDX game engine, and published it on Google Play. I learned many basics of Android and game development during the time period, and built a solid foundation to expand upon.
